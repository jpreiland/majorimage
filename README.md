- Locations: sights seen while traveling through various locations
- Magic: spells and magic items
- Shops: shops, shopkeeps, and their inventory
- NPCs: names and descriptions for NPCs
- Quests: plot hooks and quest ideas
- Materials: description, cost, and physical properties of various materials
- About: information about the project
